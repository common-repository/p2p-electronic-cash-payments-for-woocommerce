== Changelog ==

= 1.00 =
* Refactored and rewrote Bitcoin Cash Payments for Woocommerce to allow for multiple Bitcoin blockchain gateways (currently supported Cash and SV).
* Exchange rate APIs, used to get up to date exchange rates, are now fully rewritten allowing to easily plugin new APIs when needed, by extending the ExchangeRateAPI.
* Blockchain APIs, used to retrieve the balance of addresses generated for payments, are now fully rewritten allowing to easily plugin new APIs when needed, by extending the BlockchainAPI.
* Moved settings to individual gateways in order to allow for more configuration flexibility.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Are my keys kept on my server? No! No Private keys are ever stored on your server, the plugin does not need to know about them. So if you do ever get hacked there are no keys to steal, your cryptocurrency is safe. The plugin makes use of HD Master Public Key.

Does this use any payment processor? No! This uses your electrum/electron Master Public Keys, the crytocurrency goes straight from your customer's wallet to your wallet.

Are there any fees? No! This is P2P Electron Cash Payments, from your customer to you, with no middle man, no fees are ever taken at any point, nor will they ever be.

Can I contribute? Sure! Go ahead and make a pull request. Clearly explain what the change does, what's the intended result and why it's required and if it changes any existing behaviour.

== Roadmap ==
